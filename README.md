# RAG-LangChain ðŸ”—ðŸ¤–

In this repository I followed the tutorial from [LangChain](https://github.com/labdmitriy/llm-rag/tree/master) on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) which introduces various concepts that come with RAG like:
- Indexing
- Retrieval
- Generation
- Query-translation
- Routing
- Agentic RAG
